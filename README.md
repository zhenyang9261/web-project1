# What2Fix

Have you ever had a long day, forget to run by the store and then have to no idea what to make when you get home? We all have. Using the What2Fix will allow you simlify your evening by taking the guess work out of what to make for dinner, using what you have in the pantry or fridge. The What2Fix app takes ingredients that you input and gives you tailored recipes that you can make with those ingredients (and usually some common kitchen items i.e. flour, sugar, salt, oil etc.). If you dont see anything you like, you can checkout restaurants near your current location and either dine-in, carry-out or order delivery.

## Getting Started

It is very easy to begin using the app at home, yourself!
Just follow this link: [What2Fix](https://zhenyang9261.github.io/web-project1/)

Some notes to help you have the best user experience:

- You can enter ingredients individually OR all together, with each ingredient separated by a comma (,)
- You can add new ingredients at any point in time. Just click "get recipes" to get new recipes based on your new ingredients list.

## Mobile Friendly

One goal of the What2Fix app was to make it mobile freindly because it would be much easier to pull the app up on your phone instead of going to find your laptop or login to a desktop. You can be finding ingredients you have and entering them into the app, all without having to leave the kitchen.

Feel free to open the app on your favorite mobile device or use the developer tools in your favorite browser to view the mobile layout!
